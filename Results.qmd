From the beginning of 2020 until the end of 2024, tornado and waterspout events were analyzed. One finding of the analysis revealed a great disparity in the percentages of tornadoes that started in coastal counties and moved moved further inland, as opposed to tornadoes that started further inland and made their way towards the coast.

- For all tornadoes that started in a coastal county, roughly 2.83 percent moved further inland.
```{r echo=TRUE}
inwardProbability
```
- For all tornadoes that started outside of a coastal county, about 66.7 percent of them moved toward the coast.
```{r echo=TRUE}
towardCoastProbability
```

The secondary analysis in which an investigation as to how many 'sharkworthy' tornadoes existed during the five year span resulted in a total of 17 being found, with one of those tornadoes being not applicable to this analysis, as it was located near the shark-less Great Lakes. The following map highlights the sharkworthy tornados in which green dots indicate tornado starting points(if known) and red dots indicating ending points.

This visualization really helps illustrate how rare of an occurrence it is for a tornado with the potential capability of transporting sharks inland to occur. It is also worth noticing that most of the sharkworthy tornadoes on the map do not begin in or near the actual bodies of water. Keep in mind how small of a number 17 is when you compare it to the total number of tornadoes and waterspouts all across the United States throughout the same time period, 7,834 and 990 respectively.
